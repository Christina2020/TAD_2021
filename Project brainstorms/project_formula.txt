What question do you want to answer? This should be something you *actually* want to know, and it should end in a question mark.
what is the success rate of student with dual diagnosis with a support network in college?

What source of text data will you use?
Research gate and Jstor

What are two possible answers to the question?
The success rate will be high
The success rate will be low

How will the results of the quantitative text analysis demonstrate which of those answers is correct?
By isolating the strength of the support network. If the support network is very active than the success rate will be high and vice versa for a low active support network
